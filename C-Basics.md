# Module 1
## Workouts
## 1 
In the peaceful town of Edunova, every student's academic record is maintained by an old wise owl named Professor Quill. He records student names, roll numbers, and their subject scores with utmost care in the Great Ledger of Learning. One day, you're appointed as Professor Quill's assistant, and your task is to correctly transcribe the details of a student into the record for future reference. You are given the student's name, roll number, and the marks secured in four different subjects. Help Professor Quill by neatly printing this data in the order it should appear in the ledger.
### Input Format
The first line contains a string name representing the name of the student.
The second line contains an integer roll representing the roll number of the student.
The next four lines each contain an integer representing the marks obtained in four different subjects.
### Output Format
Print the student's name in the format: Name: <name>
Print the student's roll number in the format: RollNo: <roll>
Print the marks obtained in each of the four subjects in the format: Marks: <marks>.

```C
#include<stdio.h>
#include<string.h>

void main()
{
    char name[100];
    int rollNo,m1,m2,m3,m4;
    
    scanf("%[^\n] %d %d %d %d %d", name, &rollNo, &m1, &m2, &m3, &m4);
        
    if (strlen(name) <= 100){    
        printf("Name: %s\n", name);
    }
    

    if((rollNo >= 1) && (rollNo <= 1000)){
        printf("RollNo: %d\n", rollNo);
    }
    
    
    if ((m1 <=100) && (m2 <=100) && (m3 <=100) && (m4 <=100)){
        printf("Marks: %d %d %d %d\n", m1,m2,m3,m4);
    }
}

```

## 2

In the quiet corners of the library, two friends are engrossed in a project that demands precise calculations. While one scribbles ideas, the other wrestles with two numbers one in each hand. The task seems simple: combine them to discover their power when multiplied, and then understand how one divides the other. The results could shape the outcome of their project. But if a mistake sneaks in a letter instead of a digit the whole equation collapses. Accuracy is everything in this mathematical duet.

## Input Format
The first line of input contains an integer a.
The second line of input contains an integer b.
## Output Format
Print the product of the two integers.
â€¢ Print the quotient when a is divided by b.
Print Invalid input if the input contains characters.

```C
#include<stdio.h>
#include<math.h>

void main()
{
    int a,b;
    
    if (scanf("%d %d", &a,&b) == 2){
        if ((a >= -1000 && a <= 1000) && (b >= -1000 && b <= 1000)){
            if (b != 0){
                printf("%d\n", a * b);
                printf("%d\n", a/b);
            }
               
        }
    }
    
    else{
        printf("Invalid input\n");
    }
    
}
```


## 3
In a computer science class, the instructor wants to honor the legendary computer scientist Dennis Ritchie, who co-created the C programming language. To commemorate his contributions to the field, the instructor has decided to display his name on the screen during the lecture. Help the instructor to implement a simple program to print.

## Input Format
Not applicable, as this program does not require any input from the user.
## Output Format
Print the string "Dennis Ritchie".

```C
#include<stdio.h>

void main(){
    
    char c[10];
    
    if (scanf("%s", c)){
        printf("Dennis Ritchie\n");
    }
}
```

## 4

In a geometry lab activity, students are investigating triangle angle relationships. Given two known angles of a triangle, help them determine the third angle, ensuring the input values are valid and form a proper triangle.
## Input Format
Two space-separated integers representing the first and second angles.
## Output Format
Print the third angle of the triangle.
Print "Invalid input" if either angle is negative or if their sum exceeds 180.
```C
#include<stdio.h>

void main(){
    int a,b,c;
    scanf("%d %d", &a, &b);
    c = 180 - (a+b);
    if ((a >= 0 && b <= 180) && (c)){
        printf("%d",  c);
    }
    
    else{
        printf("Invalid input");
    }
    
    
}

```

## 5 

At a civic awareness camp, participants check if they're ready for their first vote. A validation system reviews each person's age and responds with encouragement or approval based on eligibility.
## Input Format
A single integer representing the age.
## Output Format
Print "Eligible" if age is 18 or above.
Print "Not eligible" if age is below 18.
Print "Invalid input" if the age is negative.

```C
#include<stdio.h>

void main(){
    
    int age;
    scanf("%d", &age);
    
    if (age >= -10 && age <= 120){
        if (age >= 18){
            printf("Eligible");
        }else{
            printf("Not eligible");
        }
    }else{
        printf("Invalid input");
    }
    
}
```
